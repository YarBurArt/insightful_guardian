> If you're in China or Russia, where they have their [own SSL certificates](https://redos.red-soft.ru/base/redos-7_3/7_3-security/7_3-ssl/7_3-russian-ssl-sert/?nocache=1731421097454), then first clone the repository on gitee and gitflic or mos hub respectively, and then work specifically with it separately. But my repository doesn't need pull request then from you from github analogs.
